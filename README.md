## Overview

This project's goal is to find appropriate housing for new families coming into King County after Microsoft has newly hired a large number of people after their expansion into the film industry. The model sing variables such as the number of bathrooms and bedrooms; and the size of the lot and living space. However, the most important factor that affected the price was location and this could be observed after including the zip code variable. 

## Business Problem

A realtorship is experiencing an influx of smaller families coming into King County as Microsoft has expanded into the movie industry and hired substantial amount of workers. It is your job to find a home for these families, and many also live alone. The realtorship has data on the price of King County, but need your insight.
